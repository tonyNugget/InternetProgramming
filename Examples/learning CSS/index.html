                    As a cold-ass lil child, Rodham was a gangbangin' straight-up hustla among her mackdaddys all up in tha hood schools dat she attended up in Park Ridge.[11] Biatch participated up in swimmin n' softbizzle n' gots a shitload of badges as a Brownie n' a Girl Scout.[11] Biatch has often holla'd at a story[12][13][14] of bein inspired by U.S. efforts durin tha Space Race n' bustin a letta ta NASA round 1961 askin what tha fuck dat thugged-out biiiatch could do ta become a astronaut, only ta be informed dat dem hoes was not bein accepted tha fuck into tha program.[15] Biatch attended Maine Eastside High School, where she participated up in tha student council, tha school newspaper n' was selected fo' tha Nationizzle Honor Posse.[2][16] Biatch was erected class vice prez fo' her junior year yo, but then lost tha erection fo' class prez fo' her ballin' year against two thugs, one of whom holla'd at her dat "yo ass is straight-up wack if you be thinkin a hoe can be erected prez".[17] For her ballin' year, she n' other hustlas was transferred ta tha then freshly smoked up Maine Downtown High School, where dat biiiiatch was a Nationizzle Merit Finalist n' was voted, "most likely ta succeed". Right back up in yo muthafuckin ass. Biatch graduated up in 1965 up in tha top five cement of her class.[18]

Museum display case containin photographs, papers, shoes, doll, n' other early childhood artifactz of Hillary Rodham's early game
Mementoz of Hillary Rodhamz early game is shown all up in tha Lil' Willy J. Clinton Presidential Center
Rodhamz mutha wanted her ta have a independent, professionizzle game,[8] n' her father, whoz ass was otherwise a traditionalist, felt dat his fuckin lil' daughterz abilitizzles n' opportunitizzles should not be limited by gender.[19] Biatch was raised up in a ballistically conservative household,[8] n' dat freaky freaky biatch helped canvass Chicagoz Downtown Side at age 13 afta tha straight-up close 1960 U.S. prezial erection. Right back up in yo muthafuckin ass. Biatch saw evidence of electoral fraud (like fuckin votin list entries showin addresses dat was empty lots) against Republican muthafucka Slick Rick Nixon,[20] n' lata volunteered ta campaign fo' Republican muthafucka Barry Goldwater up in tha U.S. prezial erection of 1964.[21]

Rodhamz early ballistical pimpment was shaped most by her high school history mackdaddy (like her father, a gangbangin' fervent anti-communist), whoz ass introduced her ta Goldwaterz Da Conscience of a Conservative n' by her Methodist youth minista (like her mother, concerned wit thangz of social justice), wit whom her big-ass booty saw n' afterwardz briefly met, civil rights leader Martin Luther Mackdaddy Jr. at a 1962 rap up in Chicagoz Orchestra Hall.[22]

Wellesley College years
In 1965, Rodham enrolled at Wellesley College, where she majored up in political science.[23][24] Durin her freshman year, her big-ass booty served as prez of tha Wellesley Young Republicans.[25][26] As tha leader of dis "Rockefella Republican"-oriented group,[27] her big-ass booty supported tha erectionz of moderate Republicans Jizzy Lindsay ta Mayor of New York City n' Massachusetts Attorney General Edward Brooke ta tha United Hoodz Senate.[28] Biatch lata stepped down from dis position. I aint talkin' bout chicken n' gravy biatch. In 2003 Clinton would write dat her views concernin tha Gangsta Civil Rights Movement n' tha Vietnam War was changin up in her early college years.[25] In a letta ta her youth minista at dat time, her dope ass busted lyrics bout her muthafuckin ass as "a mind conservatizzle n' a ass liberal".[29] In contrast ta tha factions up in tha 1960s dat advocated radical actions against tha ballistical system, her big-ass booty sought ta work fo' chizzle within dat shit.[30][31]

By her junior year, Rodham became a supporta of tha antiwar presidential nomination campaign of Democrat Eugene McCarthy.[32] In early 1968, dat biiiiatch was erected prez of tha Wellesley College Posse Association n' served all up in early 1969.[30][33] Peepin tha assassination of Martin Luther Mackdaddy Jr., Rodham organized a two-dizzle hustla strike n' hit dat shiznit wit Wellesleyz black hustlas ta recruit mo' black hustlas n' faculty.[32] In her hustla posse role, she played a role up in keepin Wellesley from bein embroiled up in tha hustla disruptions common ta other colleges.[30][34] A number of her fellow hustlas thought she might some dizzle become tha straight-up original gangsta biatch Prezzy of tha United Hoods.[30]

To help her betta KNOW her changin ballistical views, Pimp Alan Schechter assigned Rodham ta intern all up in tha Doggy Den Republican Conference n' she attended tha "Wellesley up in Washington" summer program.[32] Rodham was invited by moderate New York Republican Representatizzle Charlez Goodell ta help Governor Nelson Rockefellerz late-entry campaign fo' tha Republican nomination.[32] Rodham attended tha 1968 Republican Nationizzle Convention up in Miami Beach. But fuck dat shiznit yo, tha word on tha street is dat dat biiiiatch was trippin like a muthafucka by tha way Slick Rick Nixonz campaign portrayed Rockefella n' by what tha fuck she perceived as tha conventionz "veiled" racist lyrics n' left tha Pubic Crew fo' good.[32] Rodham wrote her ballin' thesis, a cold-ass lil critique of tha tactics of radical hood organizer Saul Alinsky, under Pimp Schechter.[35] (Years later, while dat biiiiatch was first lady, access ta her thesis was restricted all up in tha request of tha White House n' it became tha subject of some speculation. I aint talkin' bout chicken n' gravy biatch. Da thesis was lata busted out.[35])
